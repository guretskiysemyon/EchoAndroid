# EchoAndroid
In the third part, we developed an Android application for our messenger using the Java programming language. We utilized the ROOM DB to manage local data storage on the device, and Firebase Cloud Messaging to handle instant message sending and push notifications.



###  Installation:
* Clone the repository
* The project is connected with the "EchoExp4New" project in Firebase account, and the server key and sender ID of this project are written in the API. If you want to connect to another project in your Firebase account, make sure to save the google-services.json from your Firebase in your app folder.


After you have finished all the steps, you will see the login screen below.
